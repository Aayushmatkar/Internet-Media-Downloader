A bot that download media such as videos and images with their urls or tags 
can be used to download youtube videos with help of their urls


Overview of the Project :

Downloading images just by entering what’s required is the whole purpose of this
project.
The program will ask What are you looking for? And the number of images
required.
According to the information entered by the user ,the program will download
those images in your pc.


Overview of project execution :

The project will use various python libraries such as
Beautiful soup - for parsing the html
Requests - to sent GET requests
Os - to access pc files and folders for saving
And uses the google search engine to find the required images


Application of this project :

For machine learning projects, we require datasets to train our models.
Sometimes the datasets isn’t readily available ,we need to scrape the information
required for training. For training we need a huge dataset (in our case lets assume
it to be images) it is unbearably hard to download all the images manually by
clicking one by one. This project helps in such situations.
